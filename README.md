# Turbo Courier (Unity 2D)

**Turbo Courier** is a top-down 2D driving game developed in Unity.  
The player controls a delivery vehicle whose goal is to collect ice creams and deliver them to customers as efficiently as possible.

The core challenge comes from managing turbo speed boosts and avoiding collisions, as crashing into obstacles removes active boosts and slows the player down.

## 📌 Development and Project Scope  Notes

* Wallbound was developed alongside a structured Unity learning process.

* This project is intentionally focused on core gameplay systems rather than full production polish.
The goal was to design, implement, and connect fundamental mechanics such as movement, state handling, camera behavior, and game flow in a clean and extendable way.
